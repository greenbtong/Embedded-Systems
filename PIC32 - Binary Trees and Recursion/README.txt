Lab 8
Lab 8 involves Morse code decoding and encoding using the terminal, OLED, and push buttons on the Basic I/O Shield.  A understanding of pointers, malloc(), timers, finite state machines, binary trees, and recursion will help complete this lab. Overall, this lab is an advance version of Lab 7 with recursion. 

First, I read the lab manual. Next, I created my lab8 project and imported the given files. I started with the MorseInit function in Morse.c. Next, I worked on the TreeCreate function in Tree.c. This took me awhile to figure out. After, I worked on the MorseCheckEvents and MorseDecode. Next, I continue on to the Lab8.c file. I believe I did all of that correctly.

My result looks similar to the example video. This took me about 12 hours. I need more time to work on it because I had to finish my senior thesis for physics so I used an extension. The hardest part of this lab was definitely the making the tree function. It took me awhile to understand what was going on. What I disliked about this lab was having to manually inputting Morse code. The point distribution looks appropriate. The lab manual should cover the Morse.c some more. The class lectures helped me understand binary trees.
