Lab 6
Lab 6 focuses on timers and interrupt service routines (ISR). This is often seen in embedded systems. The student will use various hardware on the I/O Shield such as: the OLED, potentiometer, switches, buttons, and LEDS. Overall, completing this lab will give the student a better understanding of reading sensors and triggering outputs. The student will use sprintf, comparing values through bitwise, and a lot of tools from the previous labs. A good understanding of binary will help in this lab. 

First, I read the lab manual. Next, I created my lab6 project and imported the given files. I started with the LED.h file. Once functional, I moved on to bounce_part1.c where I made the LED lights bounce back and forth. The speed of the moving LED will be controlled by the switches in the center of the microcontroller. It took me awhile to fully understand how the timer and ISR works so this part took me a while. Next, I worked on bounce_part2.c where I used the potentiometer to output its value onto the OLED. This part did not take long for me after understanding part 1. Next, I worked on bounce_part3.c where I used the buttons to turn on the LED. One button will turn on two LED. The buttons and switches are paired together. If the paired button is pressed while the switch is off the LED will turn on or off on contact but if the button is pressed while the switch is on the LED will turn on or off once the button is released. This took me a very long time. I had a hard time figuring out how to write the ButtonCheckEvent function, but with the help of the TAs, I was able to complete part 3.  If I were to do this lab again, I would do it earlier. I could not get the extra credit working. 

The result looks similar to the example output video. This took me about 17 hours. I found this lab worthwhile. I came out of this lab with a better understanding of the hardwares in an embedded system. I do not dislike anything. The hardest part of the lab was part3. The points distribution looks appropriate. The lab manual covered everything well enough to start off. The class lectures helped me understand ISR and timers work. I do not have a specific lab partner for Lab 9, BattleBoats.
