Lab 5
Lab 5 focuses on understanding the concept of pointers through understanding the concept of a doubly-linked list data structure. The student will use a LinkedList library to store, sort, and print the strings. They will also create a word-count function for a sorted listed. A good understanding of pointers, data structures, sorting, malloc, and free functions are needed for this lab. These are all explained in the lab manual. 

First, I read the lab manual. Next, I created my lab5 project and imported the given files. I started coding in the LinkedList.c file. I first worked on LinkedListNew, LinkedListAfter, and LinkedListGetFirst. I tested these function until the functions looked correct. Next, I worked on and tested LinkedListGetSize, LinkedListPrint, LinkedListSort and LinkedListRemove. I then uncommented the provided code on line 97 to 116 and initialized the unsorted word list. Next, I sorted and printed the list. I then worked on the SortedWordCount function and printed that out. Lastly, I wrote the script to free the sorted and unsorted list. If I were to do this lab again, I would do it earlier.

The result looks similar to the example output in the lab manual. This took me about 17 hours. I found this lab worthwhile. I came out of this lab with a better understanding of data structures, pointers, and doubly-linked list. I do not dislike anything. The hardest part of the lab was determining if my LinkedListRemove was working correctly. The points distribution looks appropriate. The lab manual covered everything well enough to start off. The class lectures helped me understand how the doubly-linked list works.
