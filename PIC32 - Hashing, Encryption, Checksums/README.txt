Lab 9
Lab 9 is a partner lab. In Lab 9, both student will develop the libraries and agents necessary for a BattleBoats game. The students are required to create a field library, a protocol library, and an artificial intelligence library.  Some concepts that will be used are const variables, hashing, checksums, encryption, finite state machines, rand(), and teamwork.

First, we read the lab manual. Next, we split the lab in half. I took the protocol and Sam took the field. We ended up doing as much as we could and worked together on the rest of each when we got stuck. Testing everything at the best of our ability we both worked on the artificialagent file. We tested everything to the best of our ability and realized our finite machine is not properly working. We're having issues reading in the enemies data and this causes our finite machine to stay at state 1 or 2. 

Our result does not look good. This took us about 16 hours. This lab was really hard and it was hard checking and realizing what was going on. The hardest part of this lab was all of the finite state machines. It took me awhile to understand what was needed for the protocol state machine. What I disliked about this lab was not having a file to test our protocol and field files. I think it was the human agent.o but I'm not to sure. Maybe it should of been clearer on the manual that that compiled file was a tester file. The point distribution looks appropriate. The lab manual should cover the protocol more thoroughly. The class lectures didn't really help. It made me more confused on how to do protocol.
