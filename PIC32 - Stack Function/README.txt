Lab 4
Lab 4 focuses on understanding data structures. To get a better understanding of data structures, the student will have to create a reverse Polish notation (RPN) calculator. A brief understanding of pointers and addresses is necessary to complete this lab. An understanding of these functions: fgets(), strtok(), atof(), and strlen() are also needed. The lab manual will explain everything thing clearly.

First, I read the lab manual. Next, I created my lab4 project and imported the given files. I started coding in the Stack.c file. I first worked on StackInit, StackIsEmpty, StackGetSize. I tested these functions with the given test script in the manual. Next, I worked on the StackPush, StackPop, and StackIsFull and I also tested these functions with the given test script in the manual. I then created the greeting and worked on reading in the users input. It took me a while to figure out how to determine if the tokens were valid inputs or not so I read up on atof() and realized that if the input is not valid it will output a 0. Knowing that, I was able to write a script to determine if the inputs are valid. Next, I made the conditions to determine an errors in the RPN calculator. I then wrote the code to complete the math expressions such as +, -, *, /. Lastly, I wrote the script to output the result. If I were to do this lab again, I would do it earlier.

The result displays the value in the stack. This value should be the only value in the stack. The end result looks good. This took me about 14 hours. I liked learning about data structures. I don't dislike anything in this lab. I think this lab was worthwhile. I do not have any suggestions for altering the lab. The hardest part of the lab is the extra credit. The point distribution is fair. The lab manual covered everything well enough and allowed me to start this lab with ease. Lecture helped me understand how RPN works.
