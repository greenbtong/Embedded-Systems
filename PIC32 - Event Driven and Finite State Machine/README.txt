Lab 7
Lab 7 focuses on finite state machines (FSMs). This is useful for systems with many states such as microwaves, dish washers, thermostat, car, and many other things. The student will use various hardware on the I/O Shield such as: the OLED, potentiometer, buttons, LEDS, and timer.  Overall, completing this lab will give the student a better understanding of FSMs. The student will use a switch function and event-driven programming used in the Bounce lab.  A good understanding of the Bounce lab will help in this lab. 

First, I read the lab manual. Next, I created my lab7 project and imported the given files. I started by creating a OLED display function. I worked on this function until I had the correct display format for each possible case. Once functional, I moved on to my enum switch, which include RESET, START, COUNTDOWN, PENDING_SELECTOR_CHANGE, PENDING_RESET. I started with the RESET and START. This part was fairly simple. It was similar to the Bounce lab. Next, I worked on the PENDING_SELECTOR_CHANGE. This took a while. It took me a while to figure out how I wanted my code to determine if the button were being held down. Once I thought of something and had it working, I moved on to COUNTDOWN which was straight forward. In this switch, the LED lights are turned on and turn off, following the time left one the oven. Next, I worked on the PENDING_RESET. The PENDING_RESET is similar to the PENDING_SELECTOR_CHANGE so it was not difficult. After everything looked good, I worked on the extra credit. It was not too difficult. It is similar to the PENDING_RESET and PENDING_SELECTOR_CHANGE. 

The result looks similar to the example output video. This took me about 12 hours. I found this lab worthwhile. I came out of this lab with a better understanding of the usefulness of a FSM in an embedded system. I do not dislike anything. The hardest part of the lab was figuring out how to determine how long the buttons are being held down. The points distribution looks appropriate. The lab manual covered everything well enough to start off. The class lectures helped me understand what each hertz represented.
